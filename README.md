# A-survey-of-secret-sharing-schemes
In this Bachelor's thesis I have briefly explained many important secret sharing schemes and added an implementation of Shamir's secret sharing scheme. 
This is intended to be an easy read for begginers in the study of secret sharing schemes with little knowledge of mathematics and computer science. 

The code for Shamir's secret sharing scheme is available in the bachelor's thesis and, separately, in  a file. The language used is Python 3.
